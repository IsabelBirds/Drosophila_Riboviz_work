The Drosophila_melanogaster_fly_rRNA_tRNA.fasta contaminants sequences file was created as follows: 

rRNA:
The Drosophila melanogaster 'D_mel_rRNA.fasta' file for rRNA was downloaded from Ribogalaxy Data Library
 Original Filename: D_mel_rRNA.fasta
 Downloaded from: https://ribogalaxy.ucc.ie/library_common/download_dataset_from_folder?library_id=03501d7626bd192f&cntrller=library&use_panels=False&id=52e496b945151ee8
 File Information: https://ribogalaxy.ucc.ie/library_common/ldda_info?library_id=03501d7626bd192f&show_deleted=False&cntrller=library&folder_id=03501d7626bd192f&use_panels=False&id=52e496b945151ee8
The file was then moved to this folder and renamed: Drosophila_melanogaster_fly_rRNA.fasta
 
tRNA: 
The Drosophila melanogaster genome release 'dmel_r6.35' file for tRNA was downloaded from Flybase.net
 Original Filename:dmel-all-tRNA-r6.35.fasta.gz
 Downloaded from: ftp://ftp.flybase.net/releases/FB2020_04/dmel_r6.35/fasta/dmel-all-tRNA-r6.35.fasta.gz
The file was then unzipped and the fasta file added to this folder and renamed: Drosophila_melanogaster_fly_tRNA_r6-35.fasta

rRNA + tRNA files were concatenated into one contaminants sequences file as follows:

$ cat Drosophila_melanogaster_fly_rRNA.fasta Drosophila_melanogaster_fly_tRNA_r6-35.fasta > Drosophila_melanogaster_fly_rRNA_tRNA.fasta

And line numbers were checked to ensure all reads were included.
